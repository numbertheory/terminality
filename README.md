# terminality
Terminal functions for macOS that I wished into existence. Use at your own discretion.

They can all be run independently, but to install them, you'd want to include just the function
in your shell's run commands (rc) file. Don't copy/paste the whole file, as each file also contains
a demo of actually running the function.

# Contents

 - [list_mimetypes](list_mimetypes.sh):

    Like a standard `ls -l`, but instead of file permissions, you see the mime-types of
    each file.
